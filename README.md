This project contains my ventures in Python for IClone. Please use at your own risk, and if you find something useful let me know.

I am always open to a better way.

Update 2.5.2021: 3D Text Speller
3DSpeller.py    - I do not understand how to publish, so I am giving this away free, so I don't spend any more time trying to make $1.
If you find it useful and want to send me a $1 to help feed my dog, it is always appreciated, but not required. Contact me for how.

the 3D Speller now has a Scale and a Glow, and the spacing is better.
The spacing after a comma is a known issue and on my to-do list, but fixing problems that only save 2 seconds tend to get very low priority so it might take me 30 minutes or 7 years.

The glow works best usually with not too much glow or it "burns" the image sometimes if that is the right term.

I have a new video uploading as we speek, so in an hour or so it will be live: https://youtu.be/CljjctTXnGU

Please like and subscribe if you think it is worth the price of free.

If I owe you money after you download and try it, I offer triple your money back, plus a small $1.50 restocking fee.

Let me know if you what you think of the speller.

Poker Room

The two scripts Scramble and Unscramble will be deleted, but here is a video using them.
https://youtu.be/QytGglxRNLg

Today I learned how to build a graphical user interface so I have a new script called Poker Room Python Widget.

The Shuffle Machine animations now work.

My next possibility is to learn to have a dealer really deal the cards, but it might be over my head to do this yet.

Infinite Road.py
I create a box and apply a road texture, then make 40 copies of the road.
Finally I set the camera up for the 1st and last frames so the camera moves down the road.

To use this script, you must download the file Asphalt With 4 Stripes.png from this repo, and change line 43 of this Python Script to your path:
    image_file = "C:\\Graphics\\Textures\Asphalt With 4 Stripes.png"

This is not infinite yet, it is 40 frames. Baby steps.

Here is a video using it (coming soon):

Let me know if you have any questions. I am very new to Python, but not new in general so I can maybe figure it out.
