# PythonScripts
This project will hold multiple Python projects, but it should be pretty easy to find the ones you need.

For now I only have two scripts for randomly rotating poker chips in a chip rack, as shown in this video:

I am attempting to learn to animate my shuffle machine now and will update this project once finished.

Let me know if you have any questions. I am very new to Python, but not new in general so I can maybe figure it out.
