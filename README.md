# PythonScripts
This project contains my ventures in Python for IClone. Please use at your own risk, and if you find something useful let me know.

I am always open to a better way.

Poker Room

The two scripts Scramble and Unscramble will be deleted, but here is a video using them.

Today I learned how to build a graphical user interface so I have a new script called Poker Room Python Widget.

The Shuffle Machine animations now work.

My next possibility is to learn to have a dealer really deal the cards, but it might be over my head to do this yet.

Infinite Road.py
I create a box and apply a road texture, then make 40 copies of the road.
Finally I set the camera up for the 1st and last frames so the camera moves down the road.

To use this script, you must download the file Asphalt With 4 Stripes.png from this repo, and change line 43 of this Python Script to your path:
    image_file = "C:\\Graphics\\Textures\Asphalt With 4 Stripes.png"

This is not infinite yet, it is 40 frames. Baby steps.

Here is a video using it (coming soon):

Let me know if you have any questions. I am very new to Python, but not new in general so I can maybe figure it out.
