# PythonScripts
This project will hold multiple Python projects, but it should be pretty easy to find the ones you need.

The two scripts Scramble and Unscramble will be deleted, but here is a video using them.

Today I learned how to build a graphical user interface so I have a new script called Poker Room Python Widget.

I am attempting to learn to animate my shuffle machine now and will update this project once finished.

Let me know if you have any questions. I am very new to Python, but not new in general so I can maybe figure it out.
